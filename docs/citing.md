# Citing

This repository is archived on Zenodo, which provides a DOI that can be cited to reference an environment or package. A new DOI is minted for each release, releases are done per cycle (e.g. `202401`) and then per change to the current environment (e.g. `202401.1` if a package is added/bumped).

Zenodo provides both a DOI to cite the repository as a whole, as well as DOIs for each release:

- The main DOI for the repository is [10.5281/zenodo.10548700](https://zenodo.org/doi/10.5281/zenodo.10548700), this DOI will redirect to the latest release.
- DOIs for each release can be found in the 'versions' section to the right of the page:

If you are citing a software environment used during analysis, then you should cite the release for the cycle that you used.
