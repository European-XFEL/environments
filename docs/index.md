# European XFEL Environment Management

This repository contains Conda environment specifications and lock files
defining the environments provided for users at EuXFEL.

Lock files are provided to ensure that the environments are reproducible, and to
allow users to replicate the environments provided on Maxwell locally.

You can find information about what is contained in each environment on the
[environments page](TODO) of the documentation, or by looking through the
[environments directory](TODO).

This repository also contains 'applications', which are environments that are
specific to a particular application. A list of the applications provided can
be found on the [applications page](TODO) of the documentation, or by looking
through the [applications directory](TODO).

If you would like to create your own custom environments, then

Notes on the management of our environments can be found in the
[Maintenance](TODO) section. These are intended for the maintainers of the
repository, but may be of interest to users wanting to set up their own
environments.
