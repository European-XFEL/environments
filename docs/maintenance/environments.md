# Environments

An environment is created per European XFEL experiment cycle, this is done so that previous environments are preserved for reproducibility. The files defining the environments are stored `./environments/${CYCLE}`.

Each environment directory will have two or three files:

- `base.yml` - Conda environment file containing packages which are available on a Conda channel
- `custom.yml` - optional Conda environment file containing packages built from custom recipes (see [Recipes](./recipes.md))
- `conda-lock.yml` - file generated by `conda-lock` using the environment files as inputs

Environments exist in an installation of Conda, setting up a new Conda installation is very rarely required and is covered in the [Instances](./instances.md) section.

## Environment Specification Setup

### Creating New Specifications

The first step to creating a new environment is activating an installation, this can be done with `module load exfel mambaforge`. Loading this module will initialise the Conda instance into the `base` environment which provides `grayskull` and `conda-lock` which are used to create the environments.

Once a Conda instance has been activated, you can create a new directory under either `./environments/${CYCLE}` or `./applications/${APPLICATION_NAME}/{APPLICATION_VERSION}` (note: `./` refers to **this git repository**, not the GPFS software directory) depending on whether the environment is intended to be a generic environment users will activate to write and execute their own code, or if the environment exists only to provide a specific application.

If a new **cycle environment** is being created, copy the `base.yml` and `custom.yml` files from the previous cycle, and use those as a starting point.

Otherwise create a standard Conda environment file defining the channels and the dependencies you require:

!!! info inline end

    If the environment is likely to be used as a Jupyter kernel on Max-JHub then you need to take care to have the same versions of a few packages, see [Interactive Plotting Issues in Jupyter Notebooks](#interactive-plotting-issues-in-jupyter-notebooks).

```yaml
channels:
  - conda-forge
  - defaults
dependencies:
  - numpy  # for example
```

And place any dependencies under the `dependencies` section. Note that these are Conda dependencies, from Conda channels, not from PyPI, so the package names may differ (see <https://anaconda.org/> to search through the official channels).

Once all required dependencies have been added to the dependencies list, carry on with the instructions in [Locking and Installing an Environment](#locking-and-installing-an-environment), as well as [Creating a Modulefine](#creating-a-modulefile).

### Modifying Existing Specifications

To add a new package to an existing environment, the package should be added to the `base.yml` if is is an existing package on a Conda channel, or added to `custom.yml` if it is a package where the recipe has to be created by us.

Once all required dependencies have been added to the dependencies list, carry on with the instructions in [Locking and Installing an Environment](#locking-and-installing-an-environment).

## Locking and Installing an Environment

The following command can be used to concretize the environment and update or create `conda-lock.yml`:

```bash
conda-lock \
  -f base.yml \
  -f custom.yml \
  --lockfile conda-lock.yml \  # Only if updating an existing environment
  -p linux-64
```

If the locking completes successfully, you should **add and commit all files** (`base.yml`, `custom.yml`, `conda-lock.yml`, etc...) with a description of the changes made in the commit message. Then you can then update/install the environment via:

```bash
conda-lock install --name ${ENV_NAME} ./conda-lock.yml
```

This command will update or create an environment in the currently active conda instance of the given name.

## Creating a Modulefile

If you are updating an environment, the modulefile does not require changes. If you've created a new environment, you need to create a module file for it so that users can easily activate it.

As an example, here is the module file for the `202301` cycle:

```tcl
#%Module 1.0
proc ModulesHelp {} {
    puts stdout    "Mamba environment for cycle 202301"
}

module-whatis  "Module loads the mamba environment for cycle 202301"
if { [ module-info mode load ] } {
    system    "/gpfs/exfel/sw/software/local/etc/metrics.sh 'exfel_anaconda3/202301'"
    module load mambaforge/22.11
    puts stdout    "mamba activate 202301;"
} elseif { [module-info mode remove] } {
    puts stderr    "Due to how conda-init works, conda cannot be deactivated through the module system."
}
```

The lines actually activating the environment are:

- `module load mambaforge` - load the base environment, the same one you initially activated.
- `puts stdout "mamba activate 202301;"` - effectively places the string into the users shell and executes it. This will activate the environment. Note the `;` at the end, this must be present.

### Setting a Default Modulefile

To set a default modulefile, go to the directory the modulefile is in (for cycle environments that would be `/gpfs/exfel/sw/software/xfel_modules/mamba`) and create a file called `.version` containing:

```tcl
#%Module1.0
set ModulesVersion "{NEW_CYCLE_NUMBER}"
```

This will set the default for that directory to the new cycle number.

## Creating a Kernel for Max-JHub

The following directory contains kernels which are automatically on the kernel list on Max-JHub:

```shell
/gpfs/exfel/sw/software/local/share/jupyter/kernels
```

To add a new kernel, create a new directory in this location with the name of the kernel, and then create a `kernel.json` file in that directory with the following contents:

```json
{
  "argv": [
    "${PYTHON_PATH}",
    "-m",
    "ipykernel_launcher",
    "-f",
    "{connection_file}"
  ],
  "display_name": "xfel (202301)",
  "language": "python"
}
```

The `display_name` is what will be displayed in the Max-JHub kernel list, this should be descriptive and (if for a cycle environment) include the cycle number.

Replace `${PYTHON_PATH}` with the path to the python executable for the environment, this can be easily found by loading/activating the environment and running `which python`.

## FAQ

### Interactive Plotting Issues in Jupyter Notebooks

If an environment has issues with interactive plotting in Jupyter notebooks it is likely that the packages in it are out of sync with those in the environment running Jupyter/JupyterLab on Max-JHub.

The module used for Max-JHub is mentioned on the DESY documentation page here: <https://confluence.desy.de/display/MXW/JupyterHub+on+Maxwell>. Currently this is `conda/3.8`.

You should load that environment and then check the versions of the following packages:

- ipympl
- ipywidgets
- matplotlib

And pin them to be the same as the versions currently used by Max-JHub. Currently (February 2023) this means:

```text
- ipympl=0.7.0
- ipywidgets=7.6.3
- matplotlib=3.4.2
```
